// Given image, start, and end, return best path image
// Can lead to interesting images
// Can be used to guarantee there is a path for player
// Intended use was to map graph nodes as start and end, make noisy path, then convert to spline (See PoE2 talk minute 8:20)
// A* implementation seems intuitive for single destination
