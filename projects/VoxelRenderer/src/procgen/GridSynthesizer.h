// Generate a 2D grid of tile keys
// A tile key contains constraints, which then resolves to a tile. 
// Each tile defines an volume of voxels, differing from indvidual ImageSynthesizer
// Can manually make tiles, applied later. 
// Conceived with intent of Wave function collapse with random image.
// Can stitch muliple wfc grids with a separate set of rules, hence MultiGridCombiner
