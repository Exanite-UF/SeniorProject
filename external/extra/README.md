# Extra

This folder contains miscellaneous libraries that aren't explicitly configured as a CMake target.
The purpose of this folder is to make it easier to add libraries without needing to write additional CMake code.
If additional configuration or control is needed, we can easily convert the related libraries into a proper CMake target.
